# Engibengi's keymaps

This repository contains my keymaps for my qmk keyboards (see list below), with the aim of having a simple, hassle free experience.

## My keyboards

As of now I only own one qmk keyboard:
- crkbd's corne (42 keys)

## My Layout

I use a Colemak-DH layout for my base layout with some addition on the sides and home-row mods.
Other than that there are three more layers:
- LOWER: layer with navigation, media control, and numpad (doesn't actually use numpad keys, but standard ones, to avoid numlock stuff)
- RAISE: layer with all symbols, organized in an easy to type way
- FUNCTION: layer with all function keys, for shortcuts

In order to get access to layers I use the main thumb keys (the most central ones for me), where LOWER is obtained by longpressing the space key (left thumb), RAISE by longpressing the enter key (right thumb), and FUNCTION by longpressing them both.

## TODOs:

### Must:
- [ ] optimize symbols layer

### Maybe:
- [ ] add a gaming layer (QWERTY maybe?)
- [ ] figure out a way to use empty keys, especially on FUNCTION layer may be useful
- [ ] configure OLEDs
